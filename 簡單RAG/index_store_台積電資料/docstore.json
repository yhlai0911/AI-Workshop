Advanced technologies defined as 7nanometer and below accounted for\n69% of wafer revenue.\nMoving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 11% quarter over quarter to account for 51% of our third quarter revenue. Smartphone\nincreased 16% to account for 34%. IOT increased 35% to account for 7%. Automotive increased 6% to account for 5%. DCE decreased 19% to\naccount for 1%.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD2.2 trillion or USD69 billion. On the liability\nside, current liabilities increased by TWD31 billion, while long term interest bearing debt decreased by TWD38 billion. This change was primarily\ndriven by the reclassification of TWD42 billion in bonds payable from noncurrent to current liabilities.\nIn terms of financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remain steady at 28 days. Inventory days increased by four days to 87 days, primarily\ndue to the prebuild of N3 and N5 wafers.\nRegarding cash flow and CapEx, during the third quarter, we generated about TWD392 billion. In cash from operations, spent TWD207 billion in\nCapEx and distributed TWD91 billion for fourth quarter '23 cash dividend.\nOverall, our cash balance increased TWD88 billion to TWD1.9 trillion at the end of the quarter. In US dollar terms, Our third quarter capital expenditures\ntotaled USD6.4 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance.\nBased on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD26.1 billion and USD26.9 billion which represents\na 13% sequential increase or a 35% year over year increase at the midpoint. Based on exchange rate assumption of USD1 to TWD32, gross margin\nis expected to be between 57% and 59%. Operating margin between 46.5% and 48.5%. This concludes my financial presentation.\nNow let me turn to our key messages. I will start by talking about our third quarter '24 and fourth quarter '24 profitability. Compared to the second\nquarter, our third quarter growth margin increased by 460 basis points sequentially to 57.8%, primarily due to a higher capacity utilization rate and\nbetter cost improvement efforts including productivity gains.\nCompared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago by 230 basis\npoints, mainly due to a higher than expected overall capacity utilization rate.\nWe have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to increase by 20 basis points to 58% at the midpoint. This is primarily due to a higher overall\ncapacity utilization rate in the fourth quarter, partially offset by continued dilution from N3 ramp-up, higher electricity prices in Taiwan, and N5 to\nN3 tool conversion cost.\nNext, let me talk about our 2024 CapEx. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years. And our\nCapEx and capacity planning is always based on the long term market demand profile.\nAs the strong structural AI related demand continues, we continue to invest to support our customers' growth. We now expect our 2024 CapEx to\nbe slightly higher than $30 billion. Between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies. About 10%\nto 20% will be spent for specialty technologies and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask-making, and others. At TSMC,\na higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with higher growth opportunities in the following years. And as long as our growth\noutlook remains strong, we will continue to invest.

Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you. Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our third quarter with revenue\nof USD23.5 billion, above our guidance in US dollar terms. Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI related\ndemand for our industry leading 3 nanometer and 5 nanometer technologies.\nMoving into first quarter, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading edge process technologies. We\ncontinue to observe extremely robust AI related demand from our customers throughout the second half of 2024, leading to increasing overall\ncapacity utilization rate for our leading 3 nanometer and 5 nanometer process technologies.\nAt TSMC, we define server AI processors as GPUs, AI accelerators, and CPUs performing training and influence functions, and do not include\nnetworking, edge, or on-device AI. We now forecast the revenue contribution from server AI processors to more than triple this year, and account\nfor mid-teens percentage of our total revenue in 2024. Supported by our technology leadership and broad customer base, we are well-positioned\nto capture the industry\u2019s growth opportunities. We now forecast our full year revenue to increase by close to 30% in US dollar terms.\nNext, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC\u2019s mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the\nglobal logic IC industry for years to come. All of our overseas decisions are based on our customers\u2019 needs, as they value some geographic flexibility,\nand a necessary level of government support. This is also to maximize the value of our shareholders.\nIn Arizona, we have received a strong commitment and support from our US customers and the US Federal, state, and city governments, and have\nmade significant progress in the past several months. Our plan to build three fabs will help create greater economies of scale as each of our fab in\nArizona will have a clean room area that is approximately double the size of a typical logical fab.\nOur first fab entered engineering wafer production in April with 4 nanometer process technology, and the result is a highly satisfactory, with a very\ngood yield. This is an important operational milestone for TSMC and our customers, demonstrating TSMC\u2019s strong manufacturing capability and\nexecution.\nWe now expect volume production of our first fab to start in the beginning of 2025 and are confident to deliver the same level of manufacturing\nquality and reliability from our fab in Arizona, as from our fabs in Taiwan. Our second and third fabs will utilize more advanced technologies based\non our customers needs.\nThe second fab is scheduled to begin volume production in 2028 and our third fab will begin production by the end of the decade. Thus, TSMC\nwill continue to play a critical and integral role in enabling our customers\u2019 success, while remaining a key partner and enabler of the US semiconductor\nindustry.\nNext, in Japan, thanks to the strong support from the Japan central, prefectural, and local governments, our progress is also very successful. Our\nfirst specialty technology fab has completed all process qualification. Volume production was started this quarter and we are confident to deliver\nthe same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Kumamoto, as from our fabs in Taiwan.\nThe land preparation for our second specialty technology fab in Kumamoto has already begun and construction will begin in first quarter next\nyear. This second fab will support our strategic customers for consumer, automotive, industrial, and HPC related applications; and volume production\nis targeted by the end of 2027.\nIn Europe, we have received strong commitment from European Commission and the German Federal, state, and city governments. Together with\nour JV partners, we held a groundbreaking ceremony in August for our specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany.\nThis fab will focus on automotive and industrial applications, utilizing 12/16 and 22/28 nanometer process technologies. Volume production is\nscheduled to begin by the end of 2027.\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

This concludes our key measures and thank you for your attention\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, thank you. CC. This does conclude our prepared statements. (Conference Instructions) Now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, can we\nproceed with the first participant on the line, please?\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\nGokul Hariharan, JP Morgan.\nGokul Hariharan - JP Morgan - Analyst\nYeah, thank you. Good afternoon CC, Wendell, and Jeff. My first question is on the AI investments and the growth that you see. Recently, obviously,\nthere's been a lot of questions about ROI of Gen AI investments, whether this could end up being a bubble.\nHow does the TSMC view this trend as you're making your capacity plans given you are enabling pretty much the processing capacity for pretty\nmuch everybody? And what gives you the confidence that this is going to be a more longer run growth cycle.\nAnd related to this, could CC also talk a little bit about what do you think about the duration of this current semiconductor upcycle? Do you think\nit will continue into the next couple of years or are we getting closer to the peak of this cycle? That's my first question.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, Gokul. Please allow me to summarize your first question. So Gokul's first question has two parts. The first part, I believe, is more\nfocused on the AI related demand, the ROI and sustainability of this. He notes recently, there's been a lot of questions about the return or ROI from\ngenerative AI investments, and therefore, how do we view this trend?\nIs there a worry that this demand sustainability or maybe a bubble? And very importantly, certainly what gives us the confidence that this could\nbe a more long run sustainable demand cycle for AI?\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Gokul, let me answer your question. Simply, whether this AI demand is real or not. Okay. And my judgment is real. We have talked to our\ncustomers all the time, including our hyperscaler customers who are building their own chips. And almost every AI innovators is working with\nTSMC. And so we probably get the deepest and widest look than anyone in this industry.\nAnd why I say it's real? Because we have our real experience. We have used the AI and machine learning in our fab, in R&D operations. By using AI,\nwe are able to create more value by driving greater productivity, efficiency, speed, qualities.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv.

That was almost equal to about $1 billion to TSMC. And this is a tangible ROI benefit. And I\nbelieve we are -- we cannot be the only one company that have benefited from this AI application. So I believe a lot of companies right now are\nusing AI and for their own improving productivity, efficiency, and everything. So I think it's real. Did I answer your question?\nGokul Hariharan - JP Morgan - Analyst\nYeah, that's clear. Maybe. Yeah. Could you also talk a little bit about how this fits into your view of the current semiconductor cycle also, CC?\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nSo Gokul, the second part is so we have a -- we believe the AI demand is real but how do we view the overall semiconductor demand cycle? Do we\n-- I think Gokul you are saying, do we think it's reached peak - peak out already?\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. I forgot to answer this one. The demand is real, and I believe it's just the beginning of this demand. All right. So one of my key customers say,\nthe demand right now is insane. You know, that's -- it's just the beginning. It's from scientific to be engineering, and will continued for many years.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nAnd then the overall semiconductor demand, I think.\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOverall semiconductor demand, except that the AI, I think everything is stabilized and start to improve.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Gokul?\nGokul Hariharan - JP Morgan - Analyst\nUnderstood. That's clear. Thanks CC. My second question is more to do with CapEx. I think usually if you look at the past cycles of strong demand\nuptake, TSMC\u2019s CapEx also starts to move up quite a bit. This time around 2023 and 2024, your CapEx has been reasonably stable. It's still a large\nnumber, but not really growing a lot in the $30 billion, $31 billion range.\nHow should we think about look forward when we look forward into the next couple of years? What are you doing -- what are you planning for\nCapEx growth? Is there any deceleration that TSMC has about the pace of growth that the CapEx is still a little bit lower? Or should we expect that\nthe CapEx also should start accelerating, given you\u2019re growing at 30% this year and looks like you\u2019re preparing for pretty strong growth the next\ncouple of years as well?\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So Gokul\u2019s second question is related to CapEx and looking out the next few years. So he notes that in past cycles, when demand is very\nstrong, our CapEx starts to move up. But however, this time, even with what CC described as very real and the beginning of a strong AI demand.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv.

Last quarter management quantified overseas expansion to about 2% to 3% margin.\nBut besides that, could you help us understand some of the other puts and takes? How should we think about the depreciation growth into 2025?\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Sunny, thank you for your question. So, Sunny's question first is on the gross margin outlook into 2025. She notes last time, Wendell had\nalready shared that overseas fab would dilute our gross margin probably by 2% to 3%. She wants to know besides that, what other factors should\nwe consider? And also in terms of depreciation growth.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv.

But there are a few things I can share with you, the puts and takes for 2025. Indeed, we\nexpect the dilution from N3 ramp to gradually reduce next year. We continue to sell our value. So these things will help. Plus next year will be a\nhealthy growth year, so utilization is also a positive.\nOn the other hand, as we said, there will be 2%-to-3%-point dilution from the overseas fabs when we begin to ramp them. At the same time, we\nare also converting some of our N5 capacity to N3 to meet the strong demand for N3.\nAnd also, don't forget there -- we're ramping the N2 in 2026. There will also be some preparation cost for ramping N2. And every -- as we migrate\nevery leading nodes, more and more advanced, this preparation cost will become bigger and bigger.\nNow, you also know that the electricity cost has also risen very recently. And second time in the year, 14% higher for TSMC in October. This is after\n15% increase in 2022, 17% increase in 2023, and 25% increase in 2024.\nBasically the price has doubled in the last few years. So next year, we think that electricity price for us in Taiwan will be the highest in all the regions\nthat we operate. And the higher electricity price, plus other inflationary cost, is expected to impact our gross margin by at least 1%.\nAnd finally, of course, we do not have any control or cannot forecast foreign exchange rate movement. 1% of foreign exchange rate movement\ndollar NT will have an impact of 40 basis points to our gross margin.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nThank you. so Sunny, does that sort of give you a better understanding of the puts and takes for next year?\nSunny Lin - UBS Investment Bank - Analyst\nYeah, that's very helpful. Thank you very much Wendell. So quick follow up if any of you on depreciation increase into 2025. Should we expect\nsimilar magnitude as a this year which grow about 25%? And also a quick follow up on the 2% to 3% growth margin dilution for overseas.\nIf I calculate correctly, that would imply your overseas fabs in the US And Japan could be running at close to 0 or very low growth margin to start\nwith. Would that be a conservative assumption that you are assuming at this point? Yeah.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Well, that's two follow up. So I might take that as the second question, but the first one is again, Sunny had asked about depreciation next\nyear.\nWendell Huang - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Sunny, that does give you more depreciation guidance in the January conference. Okay.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nAnd then the second question really is about our overseas fabs. As we ramp up Arizona and Japan, Sunny, I believe your question is, with that ramp\nand dilution of 2% to 3%. Does that imply the overseas fabs profitability is more closer to break even or something like that? Correct, Sunny?\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv.

Thank you, Jeff.\nWendell Huang - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Sunny, the overseas fabs have basically a lower profitability than the fabs in Taiwan, mainly because of a smaller scale and of next year will\nbe initial ramp and higher cost. So it will be -- it will have a lower profitability, but it will gradually improve over the years.\nNow, don't forget in Arizona and in Kumamoto, we are ramping more than one fabs. So when fab one begin to improve its profitability, the second\nphase comes in. And Arizona, when fab two improves, the third fab comes in. A similar situation in Kumamoto. And that's the reason why we're\nsaying that in the next three or five years, we expect 2 to 3 percentage point dilution every year.\nSunny Lin - UBS Investment Bank - Analyst\nGot it. Thank you very much.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, thank you Sunny. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please?\nOperator\nCharlie Chan, Morgan Stanley.\nCharlie Chan - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nThanks Jeff and CC, Wendell, good afternoon. First of all, also congrats for your very, very strong result and the guidance. So my first question is\nreally about your future bargain power to your customers and vendors. And what would that mean to your long term gross margin targets?\nBecause right now, even without the price adjustment next year, your gross margin is already blow up, right? It's already 57% to 58%, higher than\nmost of your customers. So, with that, do you think you will be a little bit too aggressive to further hike price to your customers?\nAnd I'm also wondering for those kinds of mature nodes, what's your pricing strategy here? So I want to ask, are the implication to, number one,\nyour long term gross margin level? And secondly, are you going to handle the potential antitrust risk, given your monopoly -- near monopoly and\nalso prepared to do some price adjustments? Thanks.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, I think Charlie's question is sort of, we always say that we value selling and its continuous and ongoing thing. So he wants to know what\ndoes this status look like with both customers and vendors? And then what is the implication to our long term gross margin target? And are we\nconcerned about monopoly or things like that? Let me start that. I think is the first part, and then the mature part, I'll summarize later.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay, Charlie, this is CC. Let me answer your question. You know, selling our value actually is a continuous and ongoing process for TSMC. We view\nall our customers as partners, and the progress of this effort on sharing our value is so far so good.\nAlso, you are talking about, we have more bargaining power with our equipment suppliers. Again, we view them as our partners. So I don't use\nthe bargaining power. We always work with them and to move to the next step. And so, both TSMC and suppliers and customers are all working\ntogether. And with the purpose of that, we can have a TSMC customer to be successful in their market. Okay? That's my goal.\nIf our customers are doing well, we can be good also. Okay? And you mentioned one thing that I have a little bit concern. You say that TSMC is a\ngross margin, now is higher than my customer, it's not true.\nYou know, look at one of the biggest AI suppliers. They have a gross margin that I probably never be able to reach in my life. But anyway, we are\nvery happy to see them be successful, and we are in a different kind of business. We are capital intensive business. So we need a very high gross\nmargin to survive and to have a sustainable and healthy growth. That's why we set up our pricing strategy. Yeah.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nAnd then a quick one, I think part of Charlie's question, the second part. Charlie, if I heard you right is sort of the outlook for mature note in terms\nof pricing.\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nI think Charlie, you're talking about the way that the anti-trust concern or something like that. Did I hear you right?\nCharlie Chan - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nYeah, I'm a little bit concerned. Same as other investors as well.\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThe anti trust are meaning that TSMC has a very high market share and with some of unnecessary competitions methodology, let me assure you\nthat the last time we proposed a new version of the Foundry 2.0, which including wafer manufacturing and packaging, and testing, mask making,\nand all others.\nAll these kind of things become more growing importance like a packaging, testing, mask making. Right now, probably is a little bit higher than\n10% of TSMC's total revenue. That's one. And all my competitors, they are IDMs in particular, they also have their packaging, testing, and mask\nmaking.\nAnd so I think Foundry 2.0 is a better reflect TSMC\u2019s addressable market, and our share is probably around 30%. So, not dominant yet. We are big.\nYes, because we performed very well. But no, it's not a kind of antitrust concerning. It's not in our picture actually. Charlie, did I answer your question?\nCharlie Chan - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nYeah, thanks. Yeah. So, I guess you won't stop your margin improvement until 75%. But anyway, I'll leave that long term margin. I'll get or guidance\nto the next caller or your next January guidance. But I do have a second question. Is that okay, Jeff, I can ask a second one.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Yes.\nCharlie Chan - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nOkay. Yeah, the second one is about your, IDM outsourcing opportunity, right? Also part of your Foundry 2.0 because one of the major IDM\nopportunities, Intel, has recently announced they want to spin off their Foundry segments, right? So, number one, TSMC, do you really expect more\noutsourcing from Intel, given this change? And even, will TSMC considered to acquire part of Intel fabs in the long term? So I think that that's that.\nAnd also quickly comment on news reporting about Samsung's IDM outsourcing opportunity. So that's my second part of the question.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So second part is on IDM outsourcing. He wants to know with the - I guess US IDM and Foundry 2.0, do we expect more outsourcing from\nthis US IDM and, you know, how do we plan for the capacity? Would we consider, I think to acquire part of this IDM\u2019s fabs or manufacturing? And\nthen how do we see outsourcing from Samsung?\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, that's a lot of questions. Let me answer one of the easiest one. Are we interested to acquire one of IDM\u2019s fabs? The answer is no. Okay, no, not\nat all. But now let's talk about the business part. It\u2019s always customers\u2019 decision for their outsourcing strategy. But I look at the business of the IDM,\none of the IDMs in California, which has been a very good customer to TSMC. And we continue to receive a sizable business from them to be frank\nwith you. So your question is whether that we continue to increase, that is too specific. So let's wait for the next few quarters to answer your question.\nCharlie Chan - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nAll right. Thank you Charlie, operator. Can we move on to the next person caller, please?\nOperator\nBruce Lu, Goldman Sachs.\nBruce Lu - Goldman Sachs - Analyst\nOkay, thank you for taking my question. My question is going back to the longer term growth outlook. I think TSMC has been guiding for 15% to\n20% revenue CAGR from '21 to '26. On the back of the insane AI demand, you know, do we have an update outlook for the revenue guidance\nbeyond 2026?\nIn addition, when TSMC guided in 2021, TSMC achieve 25% growth almost every year except for 2023. So what kind of like revenue growth outlook\nor the growth pattern in the next five years?

So thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's first question is about our long term growth outlook. He notes, yes, we did provide a long term revenue\ngrowth CAGR of between 15% to 20% CAGR in us dollar terms from '21 to '26. So he wants to know what is the updated revenue guidance, the\noutlook beyond 2026. And he also notes that when we provided this guidance in 2022, we basically were able to grow greater than 25% every year\nexcept for 2023.\nSo he wants to know the next five years. Will the growth be a similar level every year or will it be like a strong years followed by a down year sort\nof the pattern of the growth?\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay, Bruce, that\u2019s big questions you ask us whether the next five years will be as good as the past five years from '21 to '24 right now. Except the\n2023, we have a very good growth. As you said, it's always 20% to 30%. The next five years, it will be very healthy also to TSMC. But I don't have a\nlong term CAGR number to update you, but they will be very healthy also. That's so far I can assure you.\nBruce Lu - Goldman Sachs - Analyst\nSo, a quick follow up, does that insane AI demand start to help you to grow slightly faster than before?\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nSo, Bruce wants to know with the very robust AI related demand. Can we grow faster than before?\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nI hope so. But as I said today, we don't, we don't have a long term CAGR number to share with you. Okay.\nBruce Lu - Goldman Sachs - Analyst\nOkay. Let me switch gear to 2 nanometers and A16. So I think that you know the HPC demand and you know, for advanced node is very strong,\nwe do see a more customer engagement for 2 nanometers. But at the same time, we also see more chiplet design in 2 nanometers, which might\neffectively lower the 2 nanometer wafer area requirement. So how should we think about your 2 nanometer capacity build versus the 3, 5 and 7\nin the past? And how do we see the A16 migration beyond 2 nanometer?\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So Bruce's second question, as he said is on 2 nanometer and A16. He notes certainly with HPC and AI related more and more engagement\nat 2 nanometer. But he also notes or his observation with chiplets that could reduce the demand for 2 nanometer. So he really wants to know sort\nof what is the capacity build or capacity outlook for 2 nanometer that we are looking at.\nAnd also how do we see the migration from 2 nanometer to A16? Is that correct Bruce?\n12\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Let me answer this question. Yes. The chiplets have become kind of - our HPC, especially our HPC customers\u2019 strategy. Is it going to reduce\nthe capacity for 2 nanometer because they become chiplets? The answer is no. Actually we have many, many customers interested in the 2\nnanometer. And today with their activities with TSMC, we actually see more demand than we ever dream about as compared with N3. So we have\nto prepare more capacity in N2 than in N3. And following by A16, again, A16 is a very, very attractive for the AI server chips. And so actually the\ndemand is also very high and so we are working very hard to prepare both 2 nanometer and A16 capacity. Okay, Bruce. Did I answer your question?\nBruce Lu - Goldman Sachs - Analyst\nYes, perfect. Thank you.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nAll right. Thank you. Operator. Can we move on to the next participant please?\nOperator\nBrett Simpson, Arete.\nBrett Simpson - Arete Research - Analyst\nYes, thanks very much. My question was on the long term planning around AI. Keen to understand how TSMC gets comfortable with customer\ndemand for AI beyond 2025. And I asked this because it takes, you know, a couple of years before you can build a fab. So you need to be taking\nearly, an early view on, you know, what is AI look like in 2026, 2027. So how are you, how are you specifically cooperating on long term plans for\ncapacity with these AI customers? What commitments are these customers giving you? And I guess historically, we've seen hyperscaler CapEx go\nthrough digestion period. So how do you de-risk the capacity plans here for AI as we go through this, you know, really heavy demand period?\nThank you.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So Brett's first question again is on the long term planning around AI demand. His question is really for beyond 2025 given the lead times,\nhow do we plan our capacity for the long term? How do we get comfortable around the customer demand related to AI beyond 2025? I think that\nthat is your gist of your question, Brett.\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay, Brett. Thank you. Let me say again that we did talk to a lot of customers. Almost every AI innovator are working with us and that including\nthe hyperscalers. So if you look at the long term market, the long term structural and market demand profile. I think we have some picture in our\nmind and we make some judgment of course, and we work with them on a rolling basis. And so how we prepare our capacity? Actually, just like\nWendell said, we have a disciplined and throughout system to plan the appropriate level of capacity and that to support our customers\u2019 need and\nalso to maximize our shareholders value. That's what we always keep in our mind.\nBrett Simpson - Arete Research - Analyst\nOkay. My, my follow up, yeah, that's that's great. Thanks. I guess my follow up question, we've read a lot about Taiwan having energy challenges\nand this comes at a time when TSMC is preparing for a big node with 2 nanometer.\n13\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92024 Refinitiv.

And have you seen any meaningful revision upwards or downwards on that? And then I had a follow up?\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So Krish first question is really focus on PC and mobile demand. How do we see this demand going into 2025.

So again, I would like to say that for this PC and the smartphone\nbusiness not only is it gradually increase and we expect it to be healthy in the next few years because of AI related applications.\nKrish Sankar - TD Cowen - Analyst\nGot it, got it very helpful. And then my quick follow up is, I'm kind of curious, on your packaging side, advanced packaging today is part of the\nnon-wafer revenues. Obviously, you're investing in CoWoS and other technologies. How to think about that advanced packaging revenue growth\nover the next few years? And do you think at some point in the next couple of years, advanced packaging can reach corporate level gross margins\nor would it always be below that? Thank you very much?\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, thank you Krish. So Krish\u2019s second question is on advanced packaging. So we have been putting a lot of effort. So his question is, what is the\nrevenue growth outlook for advanced packaging in the next few years, and also when or do we think it can reach the corporate average gross\nmargin as well? So maybe Wendell can address.\nWendell Huang - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Krish. Advanced packaging in the next several years, let's say five years, will be growing faster than the corporate average. This year, it accounts\nfor about high single digit of our revenue. In terms of margins, yes, it is also improving, however, it's approaching corporate but not there yet.\nKrish Sankar - TD Cowen - Analyst\nThank you very much.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Krish.

Thank you for taking my question, gentlemen and also congratulations on the strong performance. I'm just wondering that with the decent\nfree cash flow increase in the recent quarter and I believe that next year will be a decent year for TSMC to grow. So, is there any opportunity for\nTSMC to consider increase the cash dividends in the near future?\nAnd how do you view the balance of capital allocation between shareholder returns and also the continued investment in the advanced technology\nlike 2 and 3 nanometer?

So Laura's first question is related around - her question really is looking at our free cash flow generation noting that it is\ncontinues to increase and then with next year being a healthy, good year, it should continue to grow.\nSo her question is there room or how do we see the cash dividend as related to free cash flow? And also I think Laura really her question was also\na balance sheet ramification. How do we balance the shareholder return interest set against what CC said, a capital intensive industry and CapEx.\nSo two parts to it, first on the cash dividend and then sort of on the balance sheet management.\nWendell Huang - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nRight? Laura, certainly dividends. Our dividend policy as we said before is sustainable and steadily increasing. And steadily increasing when we are\nharvesting the investment that is made in the past and as the free cash flows increase, that means we are harvesting the investment in the past.\nSo it's going to be steadily increasing, That's for the dividends.\nBalance sheet, where are - the primary objective of our using our balance sheet or our cash resources is organic growth. So that will bring our\nshareholders biggest return. And then whatever the free cash flow is left, then we will return part of those to our shareholders, that's always our\npolicy.\nLaura Chen - Citi - Analyst\nOkay. Yeah, that that's very consistent. But I think given our like a rich cash flow generating capabilities and also, yeah, I mean, we can probably be\nable to harvest. So I think the investor kind of expecting the dividends increase gradually. Yeah, and also my second question is about our Foundry\n2.0 model that has been discussed since last time.\nBut could you share more details on how the Foundry 2.0 is being implemented. And from different spec like the traditional logic Foundry business\nand advanced packaging. And also maybe the IDM customers, can you give us kind of an idea what will be the like a growth outlook for a different\nkind of segmentation in that new definition?\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Laura, I think you know, again in this Foundry 2.0, among the content inside, the leading process nodes, advanced packaging, will have much\nstronger growth. And on those mature nodes and conventional packaging, that's is not so rosy as advanced packaging and leading process node.\nDid that answer your question?\nLaura Chen - Citi - Analyst\nOkay. Got it.

Thank you for taking my questions. So my a very quick one from me. The first one, can you update your forecast for this year's global\nsemiconductor revenue ex-memory? I remember you were talking about around 10% growth. So can you give us a new update and also share\nwith us a preliminary outlook for next year.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So Rick's question is really can we, you know, provide an update to our forecast for whether it's semiconductor excluding memory industry\ngrowth or/and Foundry 2.0 for 2024 first?\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Well, our forecast stays the same, very similar to what we said the last time. Of course, TSMC of growth is a little bit better than the last time\nwe estimate. But overall, the whole industry is almost the same as we said in last quarter.\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nAnd then the second part of the question, what about next year?\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, we continue to say that it's too early to make a comment on 2025 growth outlook. But we are going to share with you in the next quarter\u2019s\nearnings release. Okay.\nRick Hsu - Daiwa Securities Markets Hong Kong Ltd - Analyst\nAll right. Thank you so much. It's a little question as a follow up, the second one. Can you share with us your CoWoS capacity buildup for this year\nand this year. I know you guys seem to have revised up several times. So can you share us the latest one?\nJeff Su - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Director of Investor Relations\nYeah. So Rick's second question then is to update on our CoWoS capacity plan for both 2024 and 2025 to the extent that we can share.\nC.C. Wei - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOkay, Rick, in fact, we are putting a lot of effort to increase the capacity of the CoWoS. Roughly, let me share with you, today's situation is our\ncustomers\u2019 demand far exceeds our ability to supply. So even we work very hard and increase the capacity by about more than twice, more than\ntwo times as of this year compared with last year, and probably double again, but still not enough.
