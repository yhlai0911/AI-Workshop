We've now made several additions and subtractions to our code. To make it clear what we're using, you can see [the current code for our agent](https://github.com/run-llama/python-agents-tutorial/blob/main/5_memory.py) in the repo. It's using OpenAI for the LLM and LlamaParse to enhance parsing.

We've also added 3 questions in a row. Let's see how the agent handles them:

```
response = agent.chat(
    "How much exactly was allocated to a tax credit to promote investment in green technologies in the 2023 Canadian federal budget?"
)

print(response)

response = agent.chat(
    "How much was allocated to a implement a means-tested dental care program in the 2023 Canadian federal budget?"
)

print(response)

response = agent.chat(
    "How much was the total of those two allocations added together? Use a tool to answer any questions."
)

print(response)
```

```
response = agent.chat(
    "How much exactly was allocated to a tax credit to promote investment in green technologies in the 2023 Canadian federal budget?"
)

print(response)

response = agent.chat(
    "How much was allocated to a implement a means-tested dental care program in the 2023 Canadian federal budget?"
)

print(response)

response = agent.chat(
    "How much was the total of those two allocations added together? Use a tool to answer any questions."
)

print(response)
```

This is demonstrating a powerful feature of agents in LlamaIndex: memory. Let's see what the output looks like:

```

The agent remembers that it already has the budget allocations from previous questions, and can answer a contextual question like "add those two allocations together" without needing to specify which allocations exactly. It even correctly uses the other addition tool to sum up the numbers.

Having demonstrated how memory helps, let's [add some more complex tools](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/agent/tools/) to our agent.
