# Contributing A LabelledRagDataset#

Building a more robust RAG system requires a diversified evaluation suite. That is
why we launched LlamaDatasets in [llama-hub](https://llamahub.ai). In this page,
we discuss how you can contribute the first kind of LlamaDataset made available
in [llama-hub](https://llamahub.ai), that is, LabelledRagDataset.

```

Contributing a LabelledRagDataset involves two high level steps. Generally speaking,
you must create the LabelledRagDataset, save it as a json and submit both this
json file and the source text files to our [llama-datasets repository](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_datasets). Additionally, you'll have to make
a pull request, to upload required metadata of the dataset to our [llama-hub repository](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-hub).

To help make the submission process a lot smoother, we've prepared a template
notebook that you can follow to create a LabelledRagDataset from scratch (or
convert a similarly structured question-answering dataset into one) and perform
other required steps to make your submission. Please refer to the "LlamaDataset Submission Template Notebook" linked below.

## Contributing Other llama-datasets#

The general process for contributing any of our other llama-datasets such as the
LabelledEvaluatorDataset is the same as for the LabelledRagDataset previously
described. Submission templates for these other datasets are coming soon!
